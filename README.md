## A Level Computing Project

This is my A level computer science project, it attempts to perform some manipulations on images.

The tests which are accompanied with it do not really do anything, they were used to have a look at the output produced by them manually to see if the algorithms looked to be performing as expected.  Much more detailed testing was performed manually.
